I am very lucky to be working on this Andela Project. I am lucky to be selected among top african dev to join cohort 9 of Andela. This is the last process of a longtime selection one. Need to work hard hard hard.


## 0. Pre-launch - Getting motivations and inspirations
I usually write code everyday, but still can't get time to commit for a log. I've tried this challenge so far twice but couldn't go till day 100.
For now, after spending many days looking for motivations and inspirations, I am ready to go ahead.
