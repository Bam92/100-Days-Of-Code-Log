## 0. Pre-launch - Getting motivations and inspirations
I usually write code everyday, but still can't get time to commit for a log. I've tried this challenge so far twice but couldn't go till day 100.
For now, after spending many days looking for motivations and inspirations, I am ready to go ahead.
